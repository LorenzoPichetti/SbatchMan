# ⚙️ Setup

Before continuing, **assign a name to your cluster**. This name helps organize configurations and manage jobs.  
Pick something descriptive, such as `research_cluster`, `test_cluster`, or `gpu_cluster`. Set the cluster name with:

```bash
sbatchman set-cluster-name <my_cluster_name>
```

**NOTE**

The name you assign to your cluster will be used to structure:

* Configurations
* Job results
