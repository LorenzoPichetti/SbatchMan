# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

SbatchMan comes with a command-line interface (CLI) and a Python API. 

For your first installation, it is recommended to install and use `SbatchMan` directly on your cluster, as this ensures it runs on the same machine where your jobs will execute. The preferred installation method is using `pipx`.

If you don't have `pipx`, you can install it with:
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```
You may need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

Once `pipx` is installed, you can install `sbatchman` from PyPI:
```bash
pipx install sbatchman
```

Great, you now have `SbatchMan` installed! You can check out the available commands by running:
```bash
sbatchman --help
```

Before continuing, **assign a name to your cluster**. This name helps organize configurations and manage jobs. Pick something descriptive, such as `research_cluster`, `test_cluster`, or `gpu_cluster`. Set the cluster name with:

```bash
sbatchman set-cluster-name my_cluster
```
